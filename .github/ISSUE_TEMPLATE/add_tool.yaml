        Genomes on a Tree (GoaT), an Elasticsearch-powered datastore and search index for genome-relevant metadata and sequencing project plans and statuses. Attributes can be queried against assembly and taxon indexes through 1) an [API](https://goat.genomehubs.org/api-docs), 2) a [web](https://goat.genomehubs.org) front end, and 3) a command line interface, [GoaT-cli](https://github.com/genomehubs/goat-cli). GoaT uses NCBI Taxonomy as backbone and allows retrieval of inferred values for missing attribute values based on phylogenetic interpolation. The web front end additionally provides summary visualisations for data exploration and reporting (see https://goat.genomehubs.org). GoaT was implemented as an instance of the open-source GenomeHubs codebase. For more information visit https://github.com/genomehubs/genomehubs.
