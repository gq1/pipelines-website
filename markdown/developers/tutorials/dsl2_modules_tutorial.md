title: 'Tutorial: Create a DSL2 Module'
subtitle: Creating a new module for the nf-core modules repository.
---

In this tutorial we will see how to create a new module for the nf-core modules repository. As an example, we will create a module to execute the FastqToBam function of the [FGBIO](http://fulcrumgenomics.github.io/fgbio/) suite of tools.

## Introduction

If you create a new module with the goal of contributing the code to _nf-core_, we recommend to familiarise with the community guidelines and use _nf-core tools_ as explained below.

### Module guidelines

The nf-core community has agreed on a minimal set of [guidelines](https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/modules), intended to make module most suitable for general use, i.e. to be shared across a wide variety of community workflows.

### nf-core tools

Using [nf-core tools](https://nf-co.re/tools) is the best way to adhere to the guidelines, without worrying too much and writing things from scratch.
On the website you can find more details about [installation](https://nf-co.re/tools#installation), and all functionalities for [modules](https://nf-co.re/tools#modules).

### Test data

Even before beginning the development of a module, you should identify a small dataset you can use to test its functionality. Ideally, the dataset is existing already and can be shared with other test workflows for other modules.

> :recycle: This is in active development, keep an eye for available test data [here](https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets/tree/modules/data) and how to access them using a config file (see this [change](https://github.com/nf-core/modules/pull/365)).

If you _must_ create your own test data, make sure you follow the [test data guidelines](https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/test_data_guidelines).

---

## Fork the nf-core/modules repository and branch

The first step, to contribute a module to the community repository is to fork \*nf-core modules into your own account or organisation. To do this, you should click on the top-right of the nf-core modules repository, and choose "fork" as shown in the figure below.

![fork](/assets/markdown_assets/contributing/dsl2_modules_tutorial/dsl2-mod_01_fork.png)

You then choose the account or organisation you want to fork the repository into. Once forked, you can commit all changes you need into the new repository.

In order to create a new module, it is best to branch the code into a recognisable branch. You can do this in two ways.

- You can create a new branch locally, on the terminal, using the following command:

  - ```bash
    git checkout -b newmodule

    ## alternatively: git switch -c newmodule
    ```

  - The branch will be synchronised with your remote once you push the first new commit.

- You can use the GitHub interface

  - To do this, you can select the dropdown menu on the top-left of your repository code, write the name of the new branch and choose to create it as shown below:

    ![branch](/assets/markdown_assets/contributing/dsl2_modules_tutorial/dsl2-mod_02_new_branch.png)

  - You will then sync this locally (ideally, you clone the forked repository on your working environment to edit code more comfortably)

## Create the module template

Using [nf-core/tools](https://github.com/nf-core/tools) it is very easy to create a new module. In our example, we change directory into the repository (_modules_) and we type

```bash
nf-core modules create fgbio/demofastqtobam
```

- The first word indicates the tool (i.e. the software or suite)
- We separate the keys by a forward slash (`/`)
- The second word indicates the function of the tool we are creating a module for

Nf-core tools will set up an empty module for you based on a template. Follow the instructions on the command-line and a new module will be created in the fgbio folder.

One parameter you have to specify during the creation is the `process resource label` based on the process label in the `base.config` files in workflows. You have to select one of the following labels:

- process_single
- process_low
- process_medium
- process_high
- process_long
- process_high_memory

For now can just select the default and continue.

In the next step you have to specify if you need a `meta map` with sample-specific information. Our test module will need a meta map, so select yes for the moment. If you want to know what exactly meta maps are check out the documentation [here](https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/modules#what-is-the-meta-map).
Magic will happen now: nf-core tools will create the following entries for the code of the module itself

```console
modules
    └── nf-core
        └── fgbio
            └── demofastqtobam
                ├── main.nf
                └── meta.yml
```

And also the following for the testing of the module

```console
tests
├── modules
│   └── fgbio
│       └── demofastqtobam
│           ├── main.nf
│           ├── nextflow.config
│           └── test.yml
└── config
    └── pytest_modules.yml

```

Each of the files is pre-filled according to a defined nf-core template.

You fill find a number of commented sections in the file, to help you modify the code while adhering to the guidelines, as you can appreciate in the following figure.

```nextflow
// TODO nf-core: If in doubt look at other nf-core/modules to see how we are doing things! :)
//               https://github.com/nf-core/modules/tree/master/modules
//               You can also ask for help via your pull request or on the #modules channel on the nf-core Slack workspace:
//               https://nf-co.re/join
// TODO nf-core: A module file SHOULD only define input and output files as command-line parameters.
//               All other parameters MUST be provided using the "task.ext" directive, see here:
//               https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#ext
//               where "task.ext" is a string.
//               Any parameters that need to be evaluated in the context of a particular sample
//               e.g. single-end/paired-end data MUST also be defined and evaluated appropriately.
// TODO nf-core: Software that can be piped together SHOULD be added to separate module files
//               unless there is a run-time, storage advantage in implementing in this way
//               e.g. it's ok to have a single module for bwa to output BAM instead of SAM:
//                 bwa mem | samtools view -B -T ref.fasta
// TODO nf-core: Optional inputs are not currently supported by Nextflow. However, using an empty
//               list (`[]`) instead of a file can be used to work around this issue.

process FGBIO_DEMOFASTQTOBAM {
    tag "$meta.id"
    label 'process_single'

    // TODO nf-core: List required Conda package(s).
    //               Software MUST be pinned to channel (i.e. "bioconda"), version (i.e. "1.10").
    //               For Conda, the build (i.e. "h9402c20_2") must be EXCLUDED to support installation on different operating systems.
    // TODO nf-core: See section in main README for further information regarding finding and adding container addresses to the section below.
    conda (params.enable_conda ? "bioconda::fgbio=2.0.2" : null)
    container "${ workflow.containerEngine == 'singularity' && !task.ext.singularity_pull_docker_container ?
        'https://depot.galaxyproject.org/singularity/YOUR-TOOL-HERE':
        'quay.io/biocontainers/YOUR-TOOL-HERE' }"

    input:
    // TODO nf-core: Where applicable all sample-specific information e.g. "id", "single_end", "read_group"
    //               MUST be provided as an input via a Groovy Map called "meta".
    //               This information may not be required in some instances e.g. indexing reference genome files:
    //               https://github.com/nf-core/modules/blob/master/modules/bwa/index/main.nf
    // TODO nf-core: Where applicable please provide/convert compressed files as input/output
    //               e.g. "*.fastq.gz" and NOT "*.fastq", "*.bam" and NOT "*.sam" etc.
    tuple val(meta), path(bam)

    output:
    // TODO nf-core: Named file extensions MUST be emitted for ALL output channels
    tuple val(meta), path("*.bam"), emit: bam
    // TODO nf-core: List additional required output channels/values here
    path "versions.yml"           , emit: versions

    when:
    task.ext.when == null || task.ext.when
```

The above represents the main code of your module, which will need to be changed.
NF-core tools will attempt at retrieving the correct containers (for Docker and for Singularity) as well as the Conda recipe, and those files will be pre-filled for you.

Now you just have to write the code.

## Write the code

FGBIO command line for the function _FastqToBam_ looks like the following:

```bash
fgbio --tmp-dir=tmpFolder \\
    FastqToBam \\
    -i read1.fastq.gz read2.fastq.gz \\
    -o "sampleID_umi_converted.bam" \\
    --read-structures "+T 12M11S+T" \\
    --sample "sampleID" \\
    --library "sampleID"
```

Here you should first identify:

- the inputs you need, which are mandatory
- the inputs / arguments, which are optional
- the outputs
- any value or variable you might need, associated with the sample (for example, the sample ID or other metadata)

Make sure to check the [guidelines](https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/modules#new-module-guidelines-and-pr-review-checklist) for what you should and should not include.

### Inputs and Outputs

As described in the guidelines, any information that will differ between multiple runs of the same module in a workflow (e.g. when a module is run across many samples as in fgbio) should be passed as an input, as part of a groovy map called [_meta_](https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/modules#what-is-the-meta-map). This is part of a tuple which includes the read file(s).

In our case, FGBIO also has a mandatory argument, which is not sample-specific, i.e. the read structure: this refers to the position and structure of the UMI barcode in the read. Such information will be the same for all samples and characteristics of the kit used to prepare the sequencing library. Since it is not sample specific, we will not include it in the _meta_ map. Since it is a mandatory argument, we have decided to add it to the input list: in this way, it will be visible to others who wish to reuse this module, and it will be described explicitly in the metadata YAML file.

Therefore, once we modify the template accordingly, our inputs and outputs will look like this:

```nextflow
input:
    tuple val(meta), path(reads)
    val(read_structure)

output:
    tuple val(meta), path("*_umi_converted.bam"), emit: umibam
    path "*.version.txt"                        , emit: version
```

### Passing optional args

Within nf-core modules any optional non-file parameters should be passed within a variable called `args`. At a pipeline level, these arguments are pulled into the modules via an `ext.args` variable that is defined in a `modules.conf` file. The `task` in `task.ext.args` and `task.ext.prefix` refers to the name of your module.

```
    script:
    def args = task.ext.args ?: ''
    def prefix = task.ext.prefix ?: "${meta.id}"
```

We now can substitute all our parameters with our predefined inputs, outputs and args. With the `modules.conf` every other user can run the module with the additionel arguments of choice. After the substitutions the code of the script looks as follows:

```bash
mkdir tmpFolder

fgbio --tmp-dir=${PWD}/tmpFolder \\
FastqToBam \\
$args \\
-i ${reads} \\
-o "${prefix}_umi_converted.bam" \\
--read-structures $read_structure \\
--sample ${meta.id} \\
--library ${meta.id}
```

### Export the version of the tool

Before wrapping up our code, we need to add a line to output the software version. This must go in the HEREDOC section of the end of the script block.

```bash
    cat <<-END_VERSIONS > versions.yml
    "${task.process}":
        fgbio: \$(samtools --version | sed '1!d; s/samtools \$//')
    END_VERSIONS
```

> ⚠️ Note the template you generate will include an **example** samtools command! Make sure to replace this!

Usually a software prints their version with a code similar to this

```bash
tool --version
```

However, in some cases the software outputs the version as _stderr_ and causes an exit that is recognised by Nextflow as if the process ended with an error.

In order to avoid that, we can in general print the version as part of an echo statement, like this

```nextflow
echo \$(tool --version 2>&1)
```

or pipe the output as follow

```nextlfow
tool --version |& sed 'pattern'
```

Notice the escape `\$` of the first `$` sign to distinguish between _bash_ variables and _nextflow_ variables.

      <details markdown="1">
      <summary>Tips</summary>
      - `sed '3!d'` Extracts only line 3 of the output printed by `samtools --version`
      - Determine whether the error printed to stderr or stdout, by trying to filter the line with `sed`

      ```bash
      samtools --version
      # Try filtering the specific line
      samtools --version | sed '1!d'
      ```

      - If it works, then you're reading from stdout, otherwise you need to capture stderr using `|&` which is shorthand for `2>&1 |`
      - `sed 's/pattern/replacement/'` can be used to remove parts of a string. `.` matches any character, `+` matches 1 or more times.
      - You can separate sed commands using `;`. Often the pattern : `sed filter line ; replace string` is enough to get the version number
      - It is not necessary to use `echo`
      - For non-zero error code: `command --version || true` or  `command --version | sed ... || true`
      - If the version is at a specific line you can try `sed -nr '/pattern/p'` that will return only the line with the pattern
      - To extract the version number in the middle you can also use regex pattern with `grep` as follow: `grep -o -E '([0-9]+.){1,2}[0-9]'`
      - If multiple lines are returned you can select the first one with `tool --version | head -n 1`
      </details>

Unfortunately, FGBIO manages to cause an error exit even with this solution, and we are therefore forced to use a few `bash` tricks to re-route the version and format it to be _just_ the semantic number.

```bash
    cat <<-END_VERSIONS > versions.yml
    "${task.process}":
        fgbio: \$( echo \$(fgbio --version 2>&1 | tr -d '[:cntrl:]' ) | sed -e 's/^.*Version: //;s/\\[.*\$//')
    END_VERSIONS
```

This may take a bit of time to get right.

Once that's complete, our final script will therefore look like this:

```nextflow
process FGBIO_FASTQTOBAM {
    tag "$meta.id"
    label 'process_low'

    conda "bioconda::fgbio=2.0.2"
    container "${ workflow.containerEngine == 'singularity' && !task.ext.singularity_pull_docker_container ?
        'https://depot.galaxyproject.org/singularity/fgbio:2.0.2--hdfd78af_0' :
        'biocontainers/fgbio:2.0.2--hdfd78af_0' }"

    input:
    tuple val(meta), path(reads)

    output:
    tuple val(meta), path("*.bam") , emit: bam , optional: true
    tuple val(meta), path("*.cram"), emit: cram, optional: true
    path "versions.yml"            , emit: versions

    when:
    task.ext.when == null || task.ext.when

    script:
    def args = task.ext.args ?: ''
    def prefix = task.ext.prefix ?: "${meta.id}"

    def sample_name = args.contains("--sample") ? "" : "--sample ${prefix}"
    def library_name = args.contains("--library") ? "" : "--library ${prefix}"
    def output = prefix =~ /\.(bam|cram)$/ ? prefix : "${prefix}.bam"
    """
    fgbio \\
        --tmp-dir=. \\
        FastqToBam \\
        ${args} \\
        --input ${reads} \\
        --output ${output} \\
        ${sample_name} \\
        ${library_name}

    cat <<-END_VERSIONS > versions.yml
    "${task.process}":
        fgbio: \$( echo \$(fgbio --version 2>&1 | tr -d '[:cntrl:]' ) | sed -e 's/^.*Version: //;s/\\[.*\$//')
    END_VERSIONS
    """
}
```

> :heavy_check_mark: It is always good practice to commit regularly while you write the code and comment the commit with a meaningful message. This way, you will always be able to revert the changes at any time.

### Fill in the meta.yaml

Once the main module code is written, it is often a good point to fill in the `meta.yml` file sitting alongside the `main.nf` of the module.

Here you will document key words, context information about the module, and most importantly document the input and output requirements. In general, it follows a similar shape as the pipeline schema but is no JSON file. At the top you should add the name of the module, a short description and at least three keywords, which describe the module. Afterwards, describe all used tools, usually only one. The main part of the `meta.yml` should be about the input and output requirements, which follow the same fields as the pipeline schema for a file parameter. For each input and output requirement you have to add a type, a short description about the content and a pattern. The last block contains the authors, who worked on the module, to allow other users to easily reach out to them. If you are the main developer of the module, your GitHub name will be automatically added to the `meta.yml`. The types in the `meta.yml` are limited to map, file, directory, string, integer and float. In this example module, the prebuild `meta.yml` is already filled and the input part looks as follows:

```nextflow
## TODO nf-core: Add a description of all of the variables used as input
input:
  # Only when we have meta
  - meta:
      type: map
      description: |
        Groovy Map containing sample information
        e.g. [ id:'test', single_end:false ]
  #
  ## TODO nf-core: Delete / customise this example input
  - bam:
      type: file
      description: BAM/CRAM/SAM file
      pattern: "*.{bam,cram,sam}"
```

Maps and files as shown above are the two main input / output requirements. For the other input / output types check out the [guidelines](https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/modules#documentation) and other modules.

### Lint your code

Now that you've completed code development, you are ready to check if your code is clean and up to standards.

This can also be done easily using _nf-core tools_ just by changing folder into the parent _modules_ directory and typing the command

```bash
nf-core modules lint fgbio/demofastqtobam
```

You will expect no test failed, as shown in figure below:

![lint](/assets/markdown_assets/contributing/dsl2_modules_tutorial/dsl2-mod_04_lint_module.png)

For more information on fixing linting errors in your code both locally and directly in your pull request in GitHub, check at the end of this subsection [here](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/tutorials/nf_core_usage_tutorial#installing-the-nf-core-helper-tools).

## Test your code

Once your code is polished, following any suggestions from linting, you should test the code and make sure everything works as expected.
This can also be done automatically, using the [pytest-workflow](https://pytest-workflow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) tool.

### Create a test workflow

As described above, _nf-core tools_ has created already the following files ready for you to modify.

```bash
tests
├── modules
│   └── fgbio
│       └── demofastqtobam
│           ├── main.nf
│           ├── nextflow.config
│           └── test.yml
└── config
    └── pytest_modules.yml
```

You should first open `tests/modules/fgbio/demofastqtobam/main.nf` and create a short test workflow, with available test data.

> :soon: this example is using available test data, chosen for Sarek functionalities. It will be updated according to the new [scheme](https://github.com/nf-core/modules/blob/master/tests/config/test_data.config)

In our test workflow we have to define the two mandatory inputs.
We know the test data is using QIAseq library preparation, and therefore we need to specify read structure string as an optional input, via the `args` variable.

For this we update the `nextflow.config` to pass the string to the module via `ext.args` (the publishDir declaration is from the modules template, so can be left as is - it does not affect the passing of arguments).

```nextflow
process {

    publishDir = { "${params.outdir}/${task.process.tokenize(':')[-1].tokenize('_')[0].toLowerCase()}" }

    withName: "test_fgbio_fastqtobam_paired_umi:FGBIO_DEMOFASTQTOBAM" {
        ext.args = "--read-structures +T 12M11S+T"
    }
}
```

> 💡 Note that in a pipeline context, you should define parameter values in the pipeline-level nextflow config and replace the `+T 12M11S+T` string with a parameter, such as `--read-structures ${params.read_structure_string}` to source the value from there.

Next we prepare our input tuple, to point to the correct test data

```nextflow
input = [ [id: 'test'], //meta map
                  [ file('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nf-core/test-datasets/sarek/testdata/umi-dna/qiaseq/SRR7545951-small_1.fastq.gz'), file('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nf-core/test-datasets/sarek/testdata/umi-dna/qiaseq/SRR7545951-small_2.fastq.gz') ] ]
```

Our test workflow will be very simple, and most of the code has been written by nf-core tools already. It will look like this

```nextflow
#!/usr/bin/env nextflow

nextflow.enable.dsl = 2
params.read_structure = "+T 12M11S+T"

include { FGBIO_DEMOFASTQTOBAM } from '../../../../modules/fgbio/demofastqtobam/main.nf'

workflow test_fgbio_fastqtobam {

    input = [
        [ id:'test', single_end:false ], // meta map
        [
            file(params.test_data['homo_sapiens']['illumina']['test_umi_1_fastq_gz'], checkIfExists: true),
            file(params.test_data['homo_sapiens']['illumina']['test_umi_2_fastq_gz'], checkIfExists: true)
        ]
    ]

    FGBIO_FASTQTOBAM ( input )
}
```

### Create test YAML

In order to carry out the test, _pytest-workflow_ will search for information stored in 2 files.

```bash
modules/tests/config/pytest_software.yml
modules/tests/software/fgbio/demofastqtobam/test.yml
```

We can modify these files using _nf-core tools_, moving into the parent modules directory and using a simple command:

```bash
nf-core modules create-test-yml -t fgbio/demofastqtobam
```

The tool will prompt us to make sure we want to overwrite the existing .yml file, and we can choose _yes_. We can leave defaults for entry points, test name and command.

We are then prompted for the software profile, and we have to choose between _Conda_, _Docker_ or _Singularity_, i.e. the three conteinerised solution included in the module `main.nf`.

In the example below we have chosen Conda.

![create_yaml](/assets/markdown_assets/contributing/dsl2_modules_tutorial/dsl2-mod_05_create_test_yaml.png)

This process will run the test workflow, generate the outputs and update the `test.yml` file accordingly.

### Check pytest YAML

> ⚠️ This should be already updated for you when building the template - you shouldn't have to touch these sections!

Before running some local tests, we should make sure the `pytest_software.yml` looks like we expect, i.e. contains the following lines

```yaml
fgbio_demofastqtobam:
  - modules/fgbio/demofastqtobam/**
  - tests/modules/fgbio/demofastqtobam/**
```

These lines will instruct the pre-configure GitHub Action workflow to run a pytest-workflow run also for our module, using the code stored at `modules/fgbio/demofastqtobam/**` and the test at `tests/modules/fgbio/demofastqtobam/**`.

### Run tests locally

Now we are ready to run some tests using _pytest-workflow_ in order to anticipate what will happen with :octocat: actions.

We will follow the instructions on _nf-core_ [modules repository](https://github.com/nf-core/modules#running-tests-manually).

We will run one or more of the following, depending on the software profile available on our development environment:

```bash
cd /path/to/git/clone/of/nf-core/modules/
PROFILE=docker pytest --tag fgbio_fastqtobam --symlink --keep-workflow-wd
```

or if we use _singularity_

```bash
cd /path/to/git/clone/of/nf-core/modules/
TMPDIR=~ PROFILE=singularity pytest --tag fgbio_fastqtobam --symlink --keep-workflow-wd
```

or _Conda_

```bash
cd /path/to/git/clone/of/nf-core/modules/
PROFILE=conda pytest --tag fgbio_fastqtobam --symlink --keep-workflow-wd
```

Hopefully everything runs smoothly, and we are then ready to open a pull request, and contribute to the nf-core community.

To save you having to install `pytest-workflow` separately it was added as a dependency for nf-core/tools (`>= 1.13.2`). However, if you find that you don't have a `pytest` command in your nf-core environment, or you're notified there's no `--symlinks` option, you could try and install a later version of nf-core/tools to see if that works instead.

The minimum Nextflow version required to run the tests can be found in [this `nextflow.config` file](https://github.com/nf-core/modules/blob/master/tests/config/nextflow.config#L39) in the nf-core/modules repository.

If the version of Nextflow you are using is older than the version specified there you may get an error such as `Nextflow version 20.10.0 does not match workflow required version: >=20.11.0-edge`. The error will be reported in `log.err` in the directory where the outputs from the tests were generated. See the Nextflow [releases](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow/releases) and [installation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html#installation) pages to install a later version.

```bash
NXF_VER="22.10.1" PROFILE=docker pytest --tag fgbio_fastqtobam --symlink --keep-workflow-wd
```

Once all your tests are passing - it's time to submit the module to nf-core/modules!

Back on GitHub, creating a Pull Request is very simple: on the top right of your repository you can click on the link "Pull request" as shown in the figure below:

![pull](/assets/markdown_assets/contributing/dsl2_modules_tutorial/dsl2-mod_06_pull-reqs.png)

If you have initiated the pull request from your forked repository, the direction of the request should be indicated by the arrow, as in the picture below, i.e. from your fork to the nf-core original repository

![open_pull](/assets/markdown_assets/contributing/dsl2_modules_tutorial/dsl2-mod_07_pull-reqs-open.png)

You can find more information on the GitHub [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) and the nf-core talk [_Bytesize 4: GitHub contribution basics_](https://nf-co.re/events/2021/bytesize-4-github-contribution-basics).

Make sure you are submitting the newly created branch, where your new module has been developed, into the master branch of nf-core modules.

A pull request will be created: Volunteers will review your code and will use comments and requests for changes on GitHub to interact with you and suggest changes if necessary. This is a collaborative and very interesting part of your development work.

Enjoy!
